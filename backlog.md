[Badminton Score Tracker](https://apps.garmin.com/pl-PL/apps/51606451-57e2-4f99-9420-2ba5a80b5df6) [GitHub - matco/badminton at dev](https://github.com/matco/badminton/tree/dev.) May be good. Quite fresh. "- "Save matches as Garmin Connect activities" - could be good example for saving custom activities.

[GitHub - rgibert/garmin-podcasts: Garmin Podcasts is a Garmin Connect IQ podcast app powered by Podcast Index. No external service or subscription required: all you need is you watch!](https://github.com/rgibert/garmin-podcasts) 
An example of audio content provider app. Look very solid. Good user's docs.

[GitHub - xehpuk/parkrun-barcode-garmin-connect-iq: Never forget your barcode again!](https://github.com/xehpuk/parkrun-barcode-garmin-connect-iq) 
Doesn't do much, but it looks nice. Contains a glance view.

[GitHub - danielsiwiec/timebomb: Timebomb game for garmin](https://github.com/danielsiwiec/timebomb). Looks like a game. Had not run it yet. The code seems clean. There is even a model passd to the delegate. Don't expect sofisticated mechanics/techniques, though.
